# SET-DataPortal
This repository includes the code which generates the SET Data Portal and the data which supports it visualises and makes available.  

### Data 
All data originates from publically available datasets from the World Bank, UN Statistical Division, The Observatory of Economic Complexity, and the International Centre for Tax and Development. 

### Methods 
The methods for the data treatment and measure calculations originate from the [Sources and Methods Paper](https://set.odi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sources-and-Methods-of-Data-on-Economic-Transformation.pdf) on economic transformation.  The theoretical foundation for this approach to development is well summarised in the following report. [SET Approach Paper](https://www.odi.org/publications/10748-supporting-economic-transformation-approach-paper)

### Documentation
We have attempted to document all modifications to the data. These files can be found in the data-preparation folder. I will add more documentation as the portal is improved. 

### Improvements 
We eventually aim to examine all sources within the Sources and Methods Paper and include more information on the constraints of particular sources of data. Moreover, we aim to include the indicator and country-specific information along with each plot. 

Any feedback on future improvements is more than welcome.

<h1>Supporting Economic Transformation Data Portal </h1>

<p>
This portal aims to support and motivate research focused on structural transformation in developing countries. SET broadly defines economic transformation as a process moving labour and other resources from lower to higher productive activities. This includes moving between sectors towards higher value activities (such as from agriculture to manufacturing) and within sectors (such as from subsistence farming to high-value crops), and usually involves diversification and increased value addition in export activities. Explore below the employment and production structures of the economy have changed over the past 25 years.
<p>
See the SET Approach Paper for a thorough review of the current research on structural transformation and the policies which promote economic transformation.  <a href="https://www.odi.org/publications/10748-supporting-economic-transformation-approach-paper">SET Approach Paper</a>.

<h1>Structural Change: Employment and Gross Value Added Proportions</h1>

<p>
  The process of economic transformation composes of two related but distinct processes.  One component is structural change, whereby the share of
  the labour force employed in relatively high-productivity
  sectors increases. This process has often been related to
 the reduction in the share of the labour force in agriculture
  and an increasing share of employment in manufacturing
  and high-productivity services.  Structural changes in share of gross value added typically track these changes in labour force activities. </p>


<p>
Below are area charts which examine the proportion of total employment or gross value added a particular industry embodies. These categories are based on the seven-sector codes within the UNSD employment data: Agriculture, Mining, Manufacturing, Construction, Retail, Transportation, and Other. The order of the stack aligns with the order of the HoverTool legend.

<h1>Structural Economic Transformation </h1>
<p>
SET broadly defines economic transformation as a process moving labour and other resources from lower to higher productive activities. This includes moving between sectors towards higher value activities (such as from agriculture to manufacturing) and within sectors (such as from subsistence farming to high-value crops), and usually involves diversification and increased value addition in export activities. Explore below the employment and production structures of the economy have changed over the past 25 years.
</p>

<p>
One way to examine structural economic transformation is to see how the share of employment in a given sector changes over time relative to its labour productivity.  
</p>
<p>
Below, the x-axis is the change in employment share over a given period of time. Use the widgets to the left to adjust this time period. The y-axis is the relative labour productivity of the sector in the most recent year of the plot. Thus, this visual explores whether employment has shifted with productivity.

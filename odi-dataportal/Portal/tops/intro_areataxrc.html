<h1>Structural Economic Transformation: Taxation</h1>

<p>
Domestic resource mobilization has recently emerged as a first-order development topic.  Its inclusion as in the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the mounting literature within development studies and economics on the subject signify a renewed interest in the role of domestic taxation capacity in economic development.   Formal taxation is much lower in developing countries compared to developed countries.   The average developing country raises 18 percent of GDP through taxation whereas the typical developed country formally raised over 45 percent (Gordon and Li 2009).  This inability to generate funds directly impacts the states capacity to implement the commitment and meso-productivity enhancing activities of the state.

In particular, emerging research suggests that the economic structure of an economy and the source composition of government resources are strongly related. Explore state revenue sources as a proportion of total state revenue.  The viusal to the left does not exclude revenue from natural resources whereas the chart to the right separates resource revenue. Data originates from the <a href="http://www.ictd.ac/datasets/the-ictd-government-revenue-dataset">International Center for Tax and Development</a>.
